## Iteration 2

Use TDD to create a `Museum` class that responds to the following interaction pattern. For the `recommend_exhibits` method, the `Museum` should recommend exhibits that match a `Patron`'s interests.



pry(main)> dmns.recommend_exhibits(bob)
# => [#<Exhibit:0x00007fb400bbcdd8...>, #<Exhibit:0x00007fb400b851f8...>]

pry(main)> dmns.recommend_exhibits(sally)
# => [#<Exhibit:0x00007fb400acc590...>]
```

## Iteration 3

Use TDD to update your `Museum` class so that it responds to the following interaction pattern.

For `patrons_by_exhibit_interest`, this method takes no arguments and returns a Hash where each key is an Exhibit. The value associated with that Exhibit is an Array of all the Patrons that have an interest in that exhibit.








pry(main)> bob = Patron.new("Bob", 20)
# => #<Patron:0x00007fb2011455b8...>

pry(main)> bob.add_interest("Dead Sea Scrolls")    

pry(main)> bob.add_interest("Gems and Minerals")    

pry(main)> sally = Patron.new("Sally", 20)    
# => #<Patron:0x00007fb20227f8b0...>

pry(main)> sally.add_interest("Dead Sea Scrolls")    

pry(main)> dmns.admit(bob)

pry(main)> dmns.admit(sally)    

pry(main)> dmns.patrons
# => [#<Patron:0x00007fb2011455b8...>, #<Patron:0x00007fb20227f8b0...>]

pry(main)> dmns.patrons_by_exhibit_interest
# =>
# {
#   #<Exhibit:0x00007fb202238618...> => [#<Patron:0x00007fb2011455b8...>],
#   #<Exhibit:0x00007fb202248748...> => [#<Patron:0x00007fb2011455b8...>, #<Patron:0x00007fb20227f8b0...>],
#   #<Exhibit:0x00007fb20225f8d0...> => []
# }
```

## Iteration 4

Use TDD to update your `Museum` class to add the following functionality:

* When a `Patron` is admitted to the `Museum`, they attend `Exhibits`. The `Exhibits` that a `Patron` attends follows these rules:
  * A Patron will only attend `Exhibits` they are interested in
  * A Patron will attend an `Exhibit` with a higher cost before an `Exhibit` with a lower cost.
  * If a `Patron` does not have enough `spending_money` to cover the cost of the `Exhbit`, they will not attend the `Exhibit`.
  * When the Patron attends an `Exhibit`, the cost of the `Exhibit` should be subtracted from their `spending_money` and added to the `Museum` revenue.
* A `Museum` should have a `patrons_of_exhibits` method that returns a Hash where the keys are the exhibits and the values are Arrays containing all the `Patrons` that attended that `Exhibit`.
* A `Museum` should have a method `revenue` that returns an Integer representing the revenue collected from `Patrons` attending `Exhibits`.

The `Museum` class should respond to the following interaction pattern:
